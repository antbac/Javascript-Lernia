# JavaScript

JavaScript is a very simple language, so we won't go too deep into it.

Instead will will briefly go through some syntax, the most common functions and some common mistakes.
After that we will have a code-along where we implement the game *Snake* in the browser.

You can find the slides for the lecture in the PDF if you need it.
The Snake folder contains a skeleton which we will use for the code-along, so make sure you have it on your system.

For those who want some bonus content can check out **es6.md** and **es7.md** which contains some of the most useful of the newest features in JavaScript.
Notice that all these functions or operators might not be implemented on all systems, so think it through before using them.
